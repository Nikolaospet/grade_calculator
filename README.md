# Grade Calculator

This is a Python program with a graphical user interface (GUI) that calculates the final grade based on the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS). The program allows users to input grades, ECTS credits, and the grading scale for each subject. It can calculate the approximate final grade even if the user has not completed all subjects.

## Features

- Input the number of subjects completed so far.
- Input grades, ECTS credits, and grading scale for each subject.
- Calculate the weighted average grade based on ECTS.
- Display the final grade in both x/100 and x/10 scales.
- Handles incomplete degrees by calculating approximate final grades based on completed subjects.

## Requirements

- No requirements for the executable version.

## Installation

### Download the Executable

1. Download the executable from the [releases page](https://github.com/yourusername/grade_calculator/releases).
2. Save the file to your desired location.

## Usage

1. Run the executable by double-clicking it.
2. Enter the number of subjects completed so far and click "Submit".
3. For each completed subject, enter the grade, ECTS credits, and the grading scale.
4. Click "Calculate Grade" to get the approximate final weighted grade, displayed on both x/100 and x/10 scales.

## Example

If a student has completed 3 subjects with the following details:

- Subject 1: Grade = 27, ECTS = 5, Scale = 30
- Subject 2: Grade = 85, ECTS = 10, Scale = 100
- Subject 3: Grade = 8, ECTS = 5, Scale = 10

The program will calculate the approximate final grade based on these inputs.
